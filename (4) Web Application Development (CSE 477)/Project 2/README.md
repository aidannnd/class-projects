# Project 2 - Multiple Device Sorry!
This project expands on the Project 1 codebase and adds user management with login ability, and multiplayer remote play. <br>
This is achieved through the creation of a SQLite database to read and write user data from.<br><br>

The project is a web site displayed with HTML/CSS and powered by PHP. <br>
I developed this site alongside a group of 5 using Agile software development for part of our midterm grade.<br><br>

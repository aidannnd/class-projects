# Assignment 3 - Refactoring, Files, Time, and Animation
This assignment is the second of two in creating an aquarium application that implements unit-testing based on OOP principles. This assignment removes redundancy from assignment 2, adds the ability to save the aquarium as an XML file, and animates the fish moving around the screen.
